<p>Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.</p>


<p>Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).</p>

<p>Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.</p>
